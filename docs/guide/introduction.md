# Introduction

## What is TUI.zig?

**TUI.zig** is a modern, feature-rich Terminal User Interface (TUI) library for the Zig programming language. It provides everything you need to build beautiful, interactive terminal applications with a simple, intuitive API.

## Philosophy

TUI.zig is designed with these principles:

1. **Simple API** - As easy to use as Python, but with Zig's performance
2. **Zero Dependencies** - Pure Zig, no external C libraries
3. **Cross-Platform** - Works on Linux, Windows, macOS, and BSD
4. **High Performance** - Diff-based rendering, double buffering
5. **Feature Complete** - All the widgets and features you need built-in
